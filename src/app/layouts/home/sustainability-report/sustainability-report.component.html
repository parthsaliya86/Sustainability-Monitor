                    Sustainability Monitor provides a public repository for corporate sustainability reports and annual financial reports with information about firms’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact for a broad span of firms and years. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because data about firms’ ESG impact can be spread across different formats, such as text, images, or tables, obtaining and analyzing these data is typically not a straightforward task. We rely on state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to extract quantitative and qualitative data from sustainability reports. Based on these data, we provide interactive dashboards that enable interested stakeholders visualize selected ESG performance indicators, comparing across industries, firms, and years.
